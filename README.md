# employeeware
employeeware is simple, open source software to help create, edit, view, and manage organization charts and reporting structures. It is useful for senior managers working on reorganizations of departments with several hundred team members. This software can be used to quickly change reporting structures, move teams and people around, and visualize those changes. Using this software for visualizing, reviewing, and making changes to org charts in development is much quicker, easier and less painful than trying to do it in drawing tools like PowerPoint, Visio, or Omnigraffle. When Rajiv was CTO at The New York Times, he wrote this software as a personal open source project to help reorganize a department with 450+ FTEs and 100+ contractors at NYTimes.
